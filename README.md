thermoruby
==========

DIY thermostat project designed to let you operate multiple network controlled thermostats on heaters of various types.

Currently, supported hardware is a Raspberry Pi with particular electronics and driver support. More details on these coming soon.

There are several parts of this project:

* A ruby client = thermoruby.rb and related controller and test files
* A node.js server = this is used for testing and can be used for operations. It does very little - simply returning configurations files when requested

More documentation to come, and contact welcome from interested users or contributors. science@misuse.org
